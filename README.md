# CS4080 Group Project: Kinematic collision solver

## Colaborators

- Luke Lewis
- Erick Hambardzumyan

## Project Description

This project aims to provide a library for handleing collisions between an arbitrary number of convex shapes. The library uses the seperating axis theorem to handle testing for intersections between shapes, as well as projecting the collision time between shapes.

## API

TODO: Write out functions that will be made available by the api
